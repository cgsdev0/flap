# flap

tui version of flappy bird

compile with `make flap`

run with `./flap`

only tested using g++ 11.1.0 on Ubuntu

## About

i initially wrote the program in `main.cpp`, and then tried
golfing it. the end result is what you see in `flap.cpp`, which is
a standalone program that does not depend on `main.cpp`.
